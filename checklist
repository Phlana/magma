GRAPHICS:
    torches on walls cast shadows -> some sort of vector processing for angles and how shadows are calculated
    make some actual art for tiles and character
        i was thinking of dirty worn down dark brown bricks for walls
        generally the game will have dark textures and hard to see areas
        small field of vision centered around player
